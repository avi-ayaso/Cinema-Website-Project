## Description
A website where cinema employees can subscribe anyone and everyone to any movie in the website's database. The website's database holds a number of movies drawn from an API and more can be added if you have the right permissions. Like the movies, the customers (members) are also drawn from a fake API and more members can be added to the database as well. The website holds a record of which member went to which movies and how many people watched a certain movie. The website works with permissions and each employee has a number of permission that give him the ability to view, create, update and/or delete certain data. The Website also has an admin that can manage users (employees) - deleting, editing and adding new users to the database.
